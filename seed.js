	description: "This is one of the more popular knife patterns. It was created in the 19th century for infamous knife fighter James Bowie who eventually died at the Alamo. It is a larger knife with a crossguard and a clip point. It implements the shape of the traditional Spanish folding knife. The blade is typically anywhere from 8 to 12 inches in length and is perfect for hunting and skinning.",

	review: "This was a great knife - I used it on our hunting trip and it worked like a dream."

	name: "Drop Point",
	location: "This knife slopes on the spine of the blade from the handle of the knife to the tip of the blade.",

	review: "Works great for hunting!."
	},
	{
	name: "Straight-Back",
	location: "This knife has a flat back and a curved edge. Because the back is not sharp it allows you to use your hand or fingers to apply additional pressure to increase the cutting force.  Overall itâ€™s good for slicing or chopping.",
